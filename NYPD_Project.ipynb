    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "We are building a regression model to predict complaint response time (time between when the complaint was received and when it was closed). We chose complaint response time because we believe that it is likely influenced by ethnicity and gender, and would like to test this theory. We are using RMSE as the metric to evaluate the model because it is easier to interpret than an R-squared value, as the units of RMSE would be the same as the dependent variable. All of the columns in the dataset represent features that we would know at the time of prediction, except for month_closed, year_closed, rank_abbrev_now, rank_now, outcome_description, and board_disposition. These columns are excluded because the information would not have been known until the complaints had been closed. We cleaned this dataframe by dropping the excluded columns, and created new columns to represent complain response time and number of allegations based on complaint id. We also imputed the null values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "We used the following features: complainant_ethnicity and complainant_gender. This means that we used 2 nominal features in our baseline model. We one-hot-encoded the nominal features. Our model had an RMSE of 146.02661001292563 on the testing data, so we do not believe it is a good model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "We added the rank_incident, fado_type, and complainant_age_incident features. They are good for the data and predicting complaint response time because they decreased the RMSE of our model to 139.6725824543701 on the testing data. We chose 2 to be the best degree hyperparameter for PolynomialFeatures by looping through hyperparameters of 0-4. From 0-2, the RMSE decreased, and from 3-4, the RMSE started increasing due to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Analysis\n",
    "We performed a permutation test to test the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: Our model is fair. The difference in RMSE for young and old complainants is roughly the same, and any differences are due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: Our model is unfair. The observed difference in RMSE is less than 0, meaning that our model performs worse on young people, is not due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our p-value of 0.02, there is significant evidence in favor of our alternative hypothesis. We reject the null and conclude that the difference in RMSE is not due to random chance. Therefore, our model is NOT fair. **Our model performs worse for people who are young.**"
